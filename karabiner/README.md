## Layers

| Layer Key | Layer | Domain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⇪ | Default | Cursor movement, text selection, deletion |
| ⇪ + F | Scroll / Cursor Grid | Page scrolling, mouse cursor control, link hints |
| ⇪ + G | Application | App-specific behavior (Chrome tabs, iTerm tmux, etc.) |

## Design

Left hand has three tiers: **pinky** holds Caps Lock, **pointer** selects the layer, **middle/ring** select a mode within that layer. Mode keys sit adjacent to the pointer's layer key, so each layer+mode is a single hand shape. Keys can be pressed in any order — only what's held when the action key fires matters.

Right hand layout is always the same — vim directions that stay consistent across every layer:

```
     Y  U  I  O              ← extreme (boundary jumps)
       H  J  K  L            ← core (←↓↑→)
         N  M  ,  .          ← extensions
```

**Available layer keys:** Z, X, C, V, B

---

## Application Layer (⇪+G)

The G layer provides app-specific behavior. In Chrome it controls tabs and windows, in iTerm2 it controls tmux panes, and in other apps it provides generic directional window focus.

### Chrome

#### Tab Navigation

| Key / Shortcut | Behavior | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⇪+G] + H | Prev tab | Previous tab (wraps to previous window at boundary) |
| [⇪+G] + L | Next tab | Next tab (wraps to next window at boundary) |

| [⇪+G] + O | Last tab | Last tab in current window |
| [⇪+G] + U | Jump 3 left | Jump 3 tabs to the left |
| [⇪+G] + I | Jump 3 right | Jump 3 tabs to the right |
| [⇪+G] + J | Focus window ↓ | Focus nearest Chrome window below |
| [⇪+G] + K | Focus window ↑ | Focus nearest Chrome window above |
| [⇪+G] + ; | Esc; T | Trigger Vimium Tab search |
| [⇪+G] + ' | Esc; o | Trigger Vimium history search |
| [⇪+G] + P | ⌃ + G | Toggle Gemini side panel |
| [⇪+G] + [ | ⌘ + [ | Navigate back in history |
| [⇪+G] + ] | ⌘ + ] | Navigate forward in history |
| [⇪+G] + N | ⌘ + T | New tab |
| [⇪+G] + M | Duplicate tab | Duplicate current tab |
| [⇪+G] + , | ⌘ + ⇧ + T | Reopen last closed tab |
| [⇪+G] + . | ⌘ + W | Close current tab |
| [⇪+G] + / | Detach tab | Detach tab to new window |

Tab switching (H/L/Y/O/U/I) uses Hammerspoon JXA for reliability, with hold-to-repeat (0.2s delay, 70ms interval) and cross-window wrapping via AeroSpace.

#### Tab Reorder Mode (⇪+F+G)

| Key / Shortcut | Behavior | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⇪+F+G] + H | Esc; << | Move tab one position to the left |
| [⇪+F+G] + L | Esc; >> | Move tab one position to the right |
| [⇪+F+G] + Y | Esc; 100<< | Move tab to the beginning |
| [⇪+F+G] + O | Esc; 100>> | Move tab to the end |
| [⇪+F+G] + U | Esc; 3<< | Move tab 3 positions to the left |
| [⇪+F+G] + I | Esc; 3>> | Move tab 3 positions to the right |
| [⇪+F+G] + J | Move tab + focus ↓ | Move tab to window below and follow |
| [⇪+F+G] + K | Move tab + focus ↑ | Move tab to window above and follow |

#### Tab Move Mode (⇪+D+G)

Moves the current tab to another Chrome window in the specified direction, using the tab-mover Chrome extension:

| Key / Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [⇪+D+G] + H | Move tab to Chrome window on the left |
| [⇪+D+G] + J | Move tab to Chrome window below |
| [⇪+D+G] + K | Move tab to Chrome window above |
| [⇪+D+G] + L | Move tab to Chrome window on the right |

### iTerm2

When iTerm2 is frontmost, several default layer keys are overridden with terminal-compatible sequences, and the G layer switches to tmux pane navigation.

These overrides are gated on a `raycast_active` variable set by Hammerspoon's `raycast_watcher.lua`. When the Raycast command bar is open over iTerm2, the overrides disable so keys fall through to their standard (non-iTerm) mappings — Raycast's text input then behaves like any other macOS text field. Implemented via an `always_negative: [raycast_active]` field on each iTerm-scoped section in `src/layers/default.yaml`.

#### Cursor Movement

### Workspace Operations

All workspace operations execute directly via Karabiner `shell_command` (calling `ws.sh`), bypassing AeroSpace keybindings entirely. This avoids modifier conflicts with app shortcuts like `Cmd+Shift+H`.

20 workspaces mapped to a right-hand grid:

```
6  7  8  9  0
y  u  i  o  p
h  j  k  l  ;
n  m  ,  .  /
```

| --- | --- |
| [⇪+T+W+E] + *key* | Focus workspace on monitor 1 |

### Focus Monitor 2 (⇪+T + W + R)

| Key / Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [⇪+T+W+R] + *key* | Focus workspace on monitor 2 (falls back to monitor 1) |

### Swap Windows (⇪+T + 3)

| Key / Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [⇪+T+3] + *key* | Swap all windows between focused workspace and target workspace |
| [⇪+T+3] + ' | Swap workspaces between current and next monitor |

### Nav Grid (⇪+T + W + 4)

Activates a navigation cursor on the workspace grid overlay. Use HJKL to move the cursor across the 4x5 grid. When exiting the mode (releasing keys), `ws.sh focus` runs on the selected workspace.

### Swap Implementation

Swap operations use `summon-workspace` with an empty buffer workspace (`~`) to avoid visual jitter. AeroSpace's `move-workspace-to-monitor` internally refocuses the moved workspace, causing random workspaces to flash on the source monitor. The summon-based approach only shows `~` (empty) as an intermediate state.

The `on-focus-changed` callback is deliberately disabled in `.aerospace.toml` — it fires on every intermediate focus change during swaps, causing AeroSpace to drop commands. Instead, `move-mouse window-lazy-center` is called explicitly at the end of each operation in `ws.sh`, `smart-focus.sh`, and `smart-move.sh`.

A shared PID-based lock (`/tmp/aerospace-lock.pid`) prevents concurrent aerospace script execution. Stale locks from killed processes are automatically cleaned up.

### Window State Preservation

Window-to-workspace assignments are automatically saved after every workspace operation. On AeroSpace restart, windows are restored to their previous workspaces by matching on app name and window title.

## App Layer (⇪+R)

App-specific bindings. Currently only Superhuman in Chrome.

### Superhuman Split Inbox (Chrome)

| Key / Shortcut | Behavior | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⇪+R] + H | ⇧ + ⇥ | Previous split inbox |
| [⇪+R] + L | ⇥ | Next split inbox |

## Surround Layer (⇪+Q)

Encapsulate text with symbol pairs. Karabiner sends hyper+key (⌃+⌘+⌥) to Hammerspoon's `surround.lua` eventtap, which checks for selected text via the accessibility API (no clipboard).

- **No selection**: inserts the pair and places cursor between
- **Selection**: wraps the selected text and re-selects it

Cursor navigation (H/J/K/L/Y/U/I/O/M) still works while Q is held.

### Symbol Pairs

| Key | Pair | Shift+Key | Pair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [⇪+Q] + ` | ` `` ` | [⇪+Q] + ~ | `~~` |

## System Layer (⇪+A)

macOS system toggles and input source management. Unlike other layers, A does not follow the right-hand directional layout — these are standalone utility shortcuts.

### System Toggles

| Key / Shortcut | Behavior | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⇪+A] + Y | Toggle Dock | Shows/hides the macOS Dock on the focused monitor. Uses AeroSpace `freeze-tiling` to prevent window resizing. Auto-hides when changing window focus or switching workspaces. |
| [⇪+A] + U | Toggle Notification Center | Opens/closes the Notification Center via AppleScript |
| [⇪+A] + I | Mission Control | Shows Mission Control |
| [⇪+A] + O | Show Desktop | Shows the desktop (fn+F11) |
| [⇪+A] + . | Reload All Configs | Runs `reload.sh --all` (AeroSpace, Karabiner, Hammerspoon, iTerm2, Espanso, shell, Chrome) |
| [⇪+A] + M | Toggle Sidecar | Toggles iPad Sidecar display |
| [⇪+A] + / | Clean Dock | Removes recent apps from Dock |
| [⇪+A] + , | Workspace Setup | Opens apps (iTerm2→k, Messages→n, Rize→n, Slack→m) and moves windows to assigned workspaces |

### Input Source

| Key / Shortcut | Behavior | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⇪+A] + H | English (U.S.) | Switch to English input source |
| [⇪+A] + N | Toggle Input | Toggle between input sources (⌃+⌥+Space) |

## MacBook Keyboard Ghosting

Certain key combinations are silently dropped on the MacBook's built-in keyboard due to the keyboard matrix design. The key event never reaches Karabiner at all. This does not affect external keyboards.

| Keys held | Dropped keys | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⇪ + T + Q | U, I, O, P, ; | Q was removed as a T-layer workspace mode key; now used as standalone surround layer (⇪+Q) which is unaffected |
| ⇪ + A | J, K, L, ; | A layer avoids right-hand home row; uses Y/U/I/O and H/N instead |

Always verify new multi-key combos in Karabiner EventViewer before committing to a binding.
